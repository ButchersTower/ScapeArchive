there is a problem with the closed list.

When adding to the closed list make sure you take the x and y off of the open list.

How do i deal with keeping track of f value w/o buffered f (bf).

still need to update parents i think when the g value is lower.

Once player get to end of path, clear path, open, closed, all booleans and ints and shit.

If clicked and player is currently moving to a target, stop the player from moving.

abj block of player get instantly added to open so if i update a block next
the player after start method is ran then it wont take that into account.

stop player from walking diagonaly through blocks.
